# Associative Rule learning using Eclat algorithm

## What is Associative leaning
Associative learning is a learning principle in which a human or animal remembers an information associate with another. In a nutshell, Our brain remembers information when we associate with it another information. for example, Our brain stores information about food as a next step after hunger so whenever we feel hungry our brain tells us to eat food. This means that our brain stores information in a chain and any new information is directly appended to this chain based on the connection it creates with the nodes of the chain. As we grow old we process mutliple infomation about each nodes and based on each information the characteristics or position of the node in the chain changes.
